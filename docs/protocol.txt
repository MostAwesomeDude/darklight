 '~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'

Darklight is a layer seven protocol, although it is intended to subsume 
layers seven through five cleanly and seamlessly. Its design is modeled 
loosely on some of the modern-day brightnet tools used for 
communication, most notably HTTP/SSL, Direct Connect, and Bittorrent, 
although out of all of those, only HTTP bears any resemblance to the 
actual wire protocol of Darklight.

Darklight's purpose is to provide a cryptographically impenetrable 
system for transferring files of indeterminate size and contents. To 
this end, the protocol has been designed to be secure while also being 
somewhat distributable and hideable.

API <protocol version>

 ~ This reply contains the protocol version to which the server should
conform.

BAI

 ~ This command is sent by a client to notify the server that it intends
to close the connection. Clients should wait for the server to respond,
but they are allowed to terminate the connection after sending this.

CHECKAPI

 ~ This command allows a client to retrieve the version of the
on-the-wire protocol that the server uses.

HAI [challenge]

 ~ This command authenticates a client with a server. [challenge] should 
be a hash of the client's password, decided as follows:
        Let W(plaintext, iterations) be the Whirlpool hash function. The 
        hash is defined as:
            hash = W(password, day of the month UTC)

OHAI

 ~ This reply is sent by the server to notify the client that authentication
was successful.
