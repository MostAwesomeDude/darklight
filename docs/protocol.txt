 '~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'

Darklight is a layer seven protocol, although it is intended to subsume 
layers seven through five cleanly and seamlessly. Its design is modeled 
loosely on some of the modern-day brightnet tools used for 
communication, most notably HTTP/SSL, Direct Connect, and Bittorrent, 
although out of all of those, only HTTP bears any resemblance to the 
actual wire protocol of Darklight.

Darklight's purpose is to provide a cryptographically impenetrable 
system for transferring files of indeterminate size and contents. To 
this end, the protocol has been designed to be secure while also being 
somewhat distributable and hideable.

HAI [challenge]

 ~ This command authenticates a client with a server. [challenge] should 
be a hash of the client's password, decided as follows:
        Let W(plaintext, iterations) be the Whirlpool hash function. The 
        hash is defined as:
            hash = W(password, day of the month UTC)

OHAI

 ~ This command is sent by the server to notify the client that authentication
was successful.
