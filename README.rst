DarkLight
=========

DarkLight is a simple, straightforward, line-based protocol for transferring
files. It is distinguished by a novel implementation that is effectively
invisible to IP-based filters, rendering it unfilterable and unblockable by
normal means.

Usage
-----

No usage, currently. This library has no useful frontends, utilities, or
business logic.

Bugs
----

The implementation is not yet robust enough to identify individual bugs.
Assume everything is broken. This is only a proof-of-concept tree.

Additionally, as covered in the documentation, there may be bugs in the
underlying protocol.

To Do
-----

This list is largely just for Corbin.

The GUI needs to be finished. Any of them.
